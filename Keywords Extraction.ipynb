      "Java Basics© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.Java Basics -1Java BasicsTopics in this section include:! What makes Java programs portable, secure, and robust! The structure of Java applets and applications! How Java applications are executed! How applets are invoked and executed! The Java Language, Part I! Comments! Declarations! Expressions! Statements! Garbage collection! Java SemanticsPortabilityJava programs are portable across operating systems and hardware environments.Portability is to your advantage because:! You need only one version of your software to serve a broad market.! The Internet, in effect, becomes one giant, dynamic library.! You are no longer limited by your particular computer platform.Three features make Java String programs portable:1. The language. The Java language is completely specified; all data-type sizes andformats are defined as part of the language. By contrast, C/C++ leaves these\"details\" up to the compiler implementor, and many C/C++ programs thereforeJava BasicsJava Basics -2© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.are not portable.2. The library. The Java class library is available on any machine with a Javaruntime system, because a portable program is of no use if you cannot use thesame class library on every platform. Window-manager function calls in a Macapplication written in C/C++, for example, do not port well to a PC.3. The byte code. The Java runtime system does not compile your source codedirectly into machine language, an inflexible and nonportable representation ofyour program. Instead, Java programs are translated into machine-independentbyte code. The byte code is easily interpreted and therefore can be executed onany platform having a Java runtime system. (The latest versions of the NetscapeNavigator browser, for example, can run applets on virtually any platform).SecurityThe Java language is secure in that it is very difficult to write incorrect code orviruses that can corrupt/steal your data, or harm hardware such as hard disks.There are two main lines of defense:! Interpreter level:! No pointer arithmetic! Garbage collection! Array bounds checking! No illegal data conversions! Browser level (applies to applets only):! No local file I/O! Sockets back to host only! No calls to native methodsRobustnessThe Java language is robust. It has several features designed to avoid crashesduring program execution, including:! No pointer arithmeticJava Basics© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.Java Basics -3! Garbage collection--no bad addresses! Array and string bounds checking! No jumping to bad method addresses! Interfaces and exceptionsJava Program StructureA file containing Java source code is considered a compilation unit. Such acompilation unit contains a set of classes and, optionally, a package definition togroup related classes together. Classes contain data and method members thatspecify the state and behavior of the objects in your program.Java programs come in two flavors:! Standalone applications that have no initial context such as a pre-existing mainwindow! Applets for WWW programmingThe major differences between applications and applets are:! Applets are not allowed to use file I/O and sockets (other than to the hostplatform). Applications do not have these restrictions.! An applet must be a subclass of the Java Applet class. Aplications do not need tosubclass any particular class.! Unlike applets, applications can have menus.! Unlike applications, applets need to respond to predefined lifecycle messagesfrom the WWW browser in which they're running.Java Program ExecutionThe Java byte-code compiler translates a Java source file into machine-independent byte code. The byte code for each publicly visible class is placed in aseparate file, so that the Java runtime system can easily find it. If your programinstantiates an object of class A, for example, the class loader searches thedirectories listed in your CLASSPATH environment variable for a file called A.classthat contains the class definition and byte code for class A.There is no link phase for Java programs; all linking is done dynamically atJava BasicsJava Basics -4© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.runtime.The following diagram shows an example of the Java compilation and executionsequence for a source file named A.java containing public class A and non-publicclass B:Java programs are, in effect, distributed applications. You may think of them as acollection of DLLs (dynamically loadable libraries) that are linked on demand atruntime. When you write your own Java applications, you will often integrateyour program with already-existing portions of code that reside on othermachines.A Simple ApplicationConsider the following trivial application that prints \"hi there\" to standardoutput:Java Basics© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.Java Basics -5public class TrivialApplication {  // args[0] is first argument  // args[1] the second  public static void main(String args[]) {    System.out.println(\"hi there\");  }}The command java TrivialApplication tells the Java runtime system to beginwith the class file TrivialApplication.class and to look in that file for amethod with the signature:public static void main(String args[]);The main() method will always reside in one of your class files. The Javalanguage does not allow methods outside of class definitions. The class, in effect,creates scoped symbol StartingClassName.main for your main() method.Applet ExecutionAn applet is a Java program that runs within a Java-compatible WWW browser orin an appletviewer. To execute your applet, the browser:! Creates an instance of your applet! Sends messages to your applet to automatically invoke predefined lifecyclemethodsThe predefined methods automatically invoked by the runtime system are:! init(). This method takes the place of the Applet constructor and is only calledonce during applet creation. Instance variables should be initialized in this method.GUI components such as buttons and scrollbars should be added to the GUI inthis method.! start(). This method is called once after init() and whenever your applet isrevisited by your browser, or when you deiconify your browser. This methodshould be used to start animations and other threads.! paint(Graphics g). This method is called when the applet drawing area needsto be redrawn. Anything not drawn by contained components must be drawn inthis method. Bitmaps, for example, are drawn here, but buttons are not becausethey handle their own painting.! stop(). This method is called when you leave an applet or when you iconifyyour browser. The method should be used to suspend animations and otherJava BasicsJava Basics -6© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.threads so they do not burden system resources unnecessarily. It is guaranteed tobe called before destroy().! destroy(). This method is called when an applet terminates, for example, whenquitting the browser. Final clean-up operations such as freeing up systemresources with dispose() should be done here. The dispose() method of Frameremoves the menu bar. Therefore, do not forget to call super.dispose() if youoverride the default behavior.The basic structure of an applet that uses each of these predefined methods is:import java.applet.Applet;// include all AWT class definitionsimport java.awt.*;public class AppletTemplate extends Applet {  public void init() {    // create GUI, initialize applet  }  public void start() {    // start threads, animations etc...  }  public void paint(Graphics g) {    // draw things in g  }  public void stop() {    // suspend threads, stop animations etc...  }  public void destroy() {    // free up system resources, stop threads  }}All you have to do is fill in the appropriate methods to bring your applet to life. Ifyou don't need to use one or more of these predefined methods, simply leave themout of your applet. The applet will ignore messages from the browser attemptingto invoke any of these methods that you don't use.A Simple AppletThe following complete applet displays \"Hello, World Wide Web!\" in yourbrowser window:import java.applet.Applet;import java.awt.Graphics;public class TrivialApplet extends Applet {  public void paint(Graphics g) {    // display a string at 20,20Java Basics© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.Java Basics -7    // where 0,0 is the upper-left corner    g.drawString(\"Hello, World Wide Web!\", 20, 20);  }}An appletviewer may be used instead of a WWW browser to test applets. Forexample, the output of TrivialApplet on an appletviewer looks like:HTML/Applet InterfaceThe HTML applet tag is similar to the HTML img tag, and has the form:<applet code=AppletName.class width=w height=h>[parameters]</applet>where the optional parameters are a list of parameter definitions of the form:<param name=n value=v>An example tag with parameter definitions is:<applet code=AppletName.class width=300 height=200><param name=p1 value=34><param name=p2 value=\"test\"></applet>where p1 and p2 are user-defined parameters.The code, width, and height parameters are mandatory. The parameterscodebase, alt, archives, align, vspace, and hspace are optional within the<applet> tag itself. Your applet can access any of these parameters by calling:Applet.getParameter(\"p\")which returns the String value of the parameter. For example, the applet:import java.applet.Applet;public class ParamTest extends Applet {  public void init() {    System.out.println(\"width is \" + getParameter(\"width\"));    System.out.println(\"p1 is \"    + getParameter(\"p1\"));Java BasicsJava Basics -8© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.    System.out.println(\"p2 is \"    + getParameter(\"p2\"));  }}prints the following to standard output:width is 300p1 is 34p2 is testCommentsJava comments are the same as C++ comments, i.e.,/* C-style block comments */where all text between the opening /* and closing */ is ignored, and// C++ style single-line commentswhere all text from the opening // to the end of the line is ignored.Note that these two comments can make a very useful combination. C-stylecomments (/* ... */) cannot be nested, but can contain C++ style comments.This leads to the interesting observation that if you always use C++-stylecomments (// ...), you can easily comment out a section of code by surroundingit with C-style comments. So try to use C++ style comments for your \"normal\"code commentary, and reserve C-style comments for commenting out sections ofcode.The Java language also has a document comment:/** document comment */These comments are processed by the javadoc program to generatedocumentation from your source code. For example,/** This class does blah blah blah */class Blah {  /** This method does nothing  /**   * This is a multiple line comment.   * The leading * is not placed in documentation.   */  public void nothing() {;}}Java Basics© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.Java Basics -9DeclarationsA Java variable may refer to an object, an array, or an item of primitive type.Variables are defined using the following simple syntax:TypeName variableName;For example,int a;     // defines an integerint[] b;   // defines a reference to array of intsVector v;  // reference to a Vector objectPrimitive TypesThe Java language has the following primitive types:Primitive TypesPrimitive TypeDescriptionbooleantrue/falsebyte8 bitschar16 bits (UNICODE)short16 bitsint32 bitslong64 bitsfloat32 bits IEEE 754-1985double64 bits IEEE 754-1985Java int types may not be used as boolean types and are always signed.ObjectsA simple C++ object or C struct definition such as \"Button b;\" allocatesmemory on the stack for a Button object and makes b refer to it. By contrast, youmust specifically instantiate Java objects with the new operator. For example,Java BasicsJava Basics -10© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.// Java codevoid foo() {  // define a reference to a Button; init to null  Button b;  // allocate space for a Button, b points to it  b = new Button(\"OK\");  int i = 2;}As the accompanying figure shows, this code places a reference b to the Buttonobject on the stack and allocates memory for the new object on the heap.The equivalent C++ and C statements that would allocate memory on the heapwould be:// C++ codeButton *b = NULL;      // declare a new Button pointerb = new Button(\"OK\");  // point it to a new Button/* C code */Button *b = NULL;              /* declare a new Button pointer */b = calloc(1, sizeof(Button)); /* allocate space for a Button */init(b, \"OK\");                 /* something like this to init b */All Java objects reside on the heap; there are no objects stored on the stack.Storing objects on the heap does not cause potential memory leakage problemsbecause of garbage collection.Each Java primitive type has an equivalent object type, e.g., Integer, Byte,Float, Double. These primitive types are provided in addition to object typespurely for efficiency. An int is much more efficient than an Integer.Java Basics© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.Java Basics -11StringsJava string literals look the same as those in C/C++, but Java strings are realobjects, not pointers to memory. Java strings may or may not be null-terminated.Every string literal such as\"a string literal\"is interpreted by the Java compiler asnew String(\"a string literal\")Java strings are constant in length and content. For variable-length strings, useStringBuffer objects.Strings may be concatenated by using the plus operator:String s = \"one\" + \"two\"; // s == \"onetwo\"You may concatenate any object to a string. You use the toString() method toconvert objects to a String, and primitive types are converted by the compiler.For example,String s = \"1+1=\" + 2; // s == \"1+1=2\"The length of a string may be obtained with String method length(); e.g.,\"abc\".length() has the value 3.To convert an int to a String, use:String s = String.valueOf(4);To convert a String to an int, use:int a = Integer.parseInt(\"4\");Array ObjectsIn C and C++, arrays are pointers to data in memory. Java arrays are objects thatknow the number and type of their elements. The first element is index 0, as inC/C++.Generic Array Object# elementsJava BasicsJava Basics -12© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.element typeelement 0element 1...element n-1The syntax for creating an array object is:TypeName[] variableName;This declaration defines the array object--it does not allocate memory for the arrayobject nor does it allocate the elements of the array In addition, you may notspecify a size within the square brackets.To allocate an array, use the new operator:int[] a = new int[5];  // Java code: make array of 5 intsnew int[5]5int00000In C or C++, by contrast, you would write either/* C/C++ code: make array of 5 ints on the stack */int a[5];or/* C/C++ code: make array of 5 ints on the heap */Java Basics© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.Java Basics -13int *a = new int[5];An array of Java objects such as// Java code: make array of 5 references to ButtonsButton[] a = new Button[5];creates the array object itself, but not the elements:new Button[5]5Buttonnull pointernull pointernull pointernull pointernull pointerYou must use the new operator to create the elements:a[0] = new Button(\"OK\");a[3] = new Button(\"QUIT\");In C++, to make an array of pointers to objects you would write:// C++: make an array of 5 pointers to ButtonsButton **a = new Button *[5]; // Create the arraya[0] = new Button(\"OK\");      // create two new buttonsa[3] = new Button(\"QUIT\");In C, code for the same task would look like:/* C: make an array of 5 pointers to structs *//* Allocate the array */Button **a = calloc(5, sizeof(Button *));/* Allocate one button */a[0] = calloc(1, sizeof(Button));/* Init the first button */setTitle(a[0], \"OK\");/* Allocate another button */a[3] = calloc(1, sizeof(Button));/* Init the second button */Java BasicsJava Basics -14© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.setTitle(a[3], \"QUIT\");Multi-dimensional Java arrays are created by making arrays of arrays, just as inC/C++. For example,T[][] t = new T[10][5];makes a five-element array of ten arrays of references to objects of type T. Thisstatement does not allocate memory for any T objects.Accessing an undefined array element causes a runtime exception calledArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.Accessing a defined array element that has not yet been assigned to an objectresults in a runtime NullPointerException.InitializersVariables may be initialized as follows:! Primitive typesint i = 3;boolean g = true;! ObjectsButton b = null;Employee e = new Employee();! Arraysint[] i = {1, 2, 3, 4};or in Java 1.1int[] i;i = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4};ConstantsVariables modified by the static final keywords are constants (equivalent tothe const keyword in C++; no equivalent in C). For example,// same as \"const int version=1;\" in C++static final int version = 1;static final String Owner = \"Terence\";Java Basics© 1996-2003 jGuru.com.

A proper Java statement is:// Java codenew T().method();In C++, you would use:// C++ code(new T)->method();StatementsJava statements are similar to those in C/C++ as the following table shows.Forms of Common StatementsStatementExamplesifif (boolean-expr) stat1if (boolean-expr) stat1 else stat2switchswitch (int-expr) {case int-const-expr : stat1case int-const-expr : stat2default : stat3}forfor (int i=0; i<10; i++) statwhilewhile (boolean-expr) statdo-whiledo { stats } while (boolean-expr)returnreturn expr;The Java break and continue statements may have labels. These labels refer tothe specific loop that the break or continue apply to. (Each loop can bepreceded by a label.)Java SemanticsWe say that the Java language has \"reference semantics\" and C/C++ have \"copysemantics.\" This means that Java objects are passed to methods by reference inJava, while objects are passed by value in C/C++.Java primitive types, however, are not treated in the same way as Java objects.Primitive types are assigned, compared, and passed as arguments using copyJava BasicsJava Basics -18© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.semantics, just as in C/C++. For example, i = j for two int variables i and jperforms a 32-bit integer copy.Assignment of ObjectsAssignment makes two variables refer to the same object. For example,class Data {  public int data = 0;  public Data(int d) { data = d; }}I       Data a = new Data(1); // a.data is 1I       Data b = new Data(2); // b.data is 2II      b = a;                // b.data and a.data are 1III     a.data = 3;           // b.data and a.data are 3IV      a = new Data(4);      // b.data is 3, a.data is 4To copy objects, define and use clone():class Data implements Cloneable {  public int data = 0;  public Data(int d) { data = d; }  public Object clone() {    Data d = (Data) super.clone();    d.data = data;    return d;  }}...Data a = new Data(1); // a.data is 1Data b = new Data(2); // b.data is 2b = a.clone();        // b.data and a.data are 1a.data = 3;           // b.data is 1, a.data is 3Java Basics© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.Java Basics -19Note: The above class definition requires exception handling code. We, however,have not yet discussed exception handling. For now, pretend that it is notnecessary.Method Parameters and Return ValuesArguments and return values for primitive types are passed by value to and fromall Java methods because they are implied assignments, as in C/C++. However, allJava objects are passed by reference. For example, the C/C++ code:// C++ codeint foo(int j) { return j + 34;}Button *bfoo(Button *b) {  if ( b != NULL ) return b;  else return new Button();}or, in C/* C code */int foo(int j) { return j + 34;}Button *bfoo(Button *b) {  if ( b != NULL ) return b;  else return calloc(sizeof(Button));}would be written in the Java language:// Java codeint foo(int j) { return j + 34;}Button bfoo(Button b) {  if ( b != null ) return b;  else return new Button(\"OK\");}EqualityTwo Java primitive types are equal (using the == operator) when they have thesame value (e.g., \"3 == 3\"). However, two object variables are equal if and only ifthey refer to the same instantiated object--a \"shallow\" comparison. For example,void test() {  Data a = new Data(1);  Data b = new Data(2);  Data c = new Data(1);  // a == b is FALSE  // a == c is FALSE (in C++, this'd be TRUE)Java BasicsJava Basics -20© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.  Data d = a;  Data e = a;  // d == e is TRUE,  // d,e are referring to same object}To perform a \"deep\" comparison, the convention is to define a method calledequals(). You would rewrite Data as:class Data {  public int data = 0;  public Data(int d) { data = d; }  boolean equals(Data d) {    return data == d.data;  }}...Data a = new Data(1);Data b = new Data(1);// a.equals(b) is true!!!!No Pointers!The Java language does not have pointer types nor address arithmetic. Javavariables are either primitive types or references to objects. To illustrate thedifference between C/C++ and Java semantics, consider the following equivalentcode fragments.// C++ code (C code would be similar)Stack *s = new Stack; // point to a new Stacks->push(...);// dereference and access method push()The equivalent Java code is:// Java code// internally, consider s to be a (Stack *)Stack s = new Stack();// dereference s automaticallys.push(...);Garbage CollectionAn automatic garbage collector deallocates memory for objects that are no longerneeded by your program, thereby relieving you from the tedious and error-proneJava Basics© 1996-2003 jGuru.com. All Rights Reserved.Java Basics -21task of deallocating your own memory.As a consequence of automatic garbage collection and lack of pointers, a Javaobject is either null or valid--there is no way to refer to an invalid or stale object(one that has been deallocated).To illustrate the effect of a garbage collector, consider the following C++ functionthat allocates 1000 objects on the heap via the new operator (a similar C functionwould allocate memory using calloc/malloc):// C++ codevoid f() {  T *t;  for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {    t = new T; // ack!!!!!  }}Every time the loop body is executed, a new instance of class T is instantiated, andt is pointed to it. But what happens to the instance that t used to point to? It'sstill allocated, but nothing points to it and therefore it's inaccessible. Memory inthis state is referred to as \"leaked\" memory.In the Java language, memory leaks are not an issue. The following Java methodcauses no ill effects:// Java codevoid f() {  T t;  for (int i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {    t = new T();  }}In Java, each time t is assigned a new reference, the old reference is now availablefor garbage collection. Note that it isn't immediately freed; it remains allocateduntil the garbage collector thread is next executed and notices that it can be freed.Put simply, automatic garbage collection reduces programming effort,programming errors, and program complexity.[MML: 0.995a][Version: $Id: //depot/main/src/edu/modules/JavaBasics/javaBasics.mml#3 $]Java BasicsJava Basics -22© 1996-2003 jGuru.com.
